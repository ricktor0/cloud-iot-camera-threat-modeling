# Threat Modeling and Security Challenges in Cloud-Connected IoT Camera Systems

## Overview
This repository documents the literature review and analysis process for a research study on the security risks present in modern cloud-connected surveillance camera ecosystems.

The goal of this work is to systematically analyze existing research and construct a unified threat model covering device, network, cloud, and user application layers.

Unlike traditional IoT sensors, connected camera systems continuously capture sensitive visual data and rely heavily on remote cloud services. This creates a broad and interconnected attack surface requiring structured analysis.

## Research Methodology

The study follows a systematic literature review approach:

1. Collect academic and industry research papers
2. Extract vulnerabilities and attack techniques
3. Categorize attacks into architectural layers
4. Map threats using a formal threat modeling framework
5. Identify gaps in current security approaches

## Threat Model Layers

The research analyzes security across four layers:

- **Device Layer** — embedded firmware and hardware
- **Network Layer** — communication protocols and transmission
- **Cloud Layer** — backend services and APIs
- **Application Layer** — mobile and web user interfaces

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as:

- A transparent research log
- A structured dataset of analyzed studies
- A reproducible methodology for the review paper
- Supporting material for the final publication
